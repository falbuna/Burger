## Introduction

The application "Burger Time" is a burger logger that will keep track of burgers that have been eaten and are waiting to be eaten. The user will be able to submit a new burger into the queue that are waiting to be eaten/devoured. Once they are eaten, the burger will be placed on the other column where the user can reorder the same burger again.
